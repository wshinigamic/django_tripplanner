Located in the rejuvenated Fort Canning Arts Centre, a heritage building set atop Singapore's historic and cultural landmark, Fort Canning Park, Singapore Pinacothèque takes centre stage with its distinctive expertise in international fine art, and offers a unique voice on history and culture in the region's visual arts landscape. 'Pinacothèque' translates as 'box of paintings' and refers to a place where paintings (or any image) are kept in which private collector pieces were displayed for public appreciation. We aim to stimulate your sense of curiosity and wonder through uniquely curated exhibitions, and by combining storytelling with state-of-the-art technology to create an experience that is immersive, interactive, engaging and fun. The museum's three main galleries feature a permanent collection of masterpieces, twice-yearly rotating blockbuster exhibitions, and a collection of artefacts that traces the legacy of Southeast Asia and Singapore. Delivering a fresh perspective on art, the exhibitions are curated with founder Marc Restellini's signature 'Transversality' credo that presents a dialogue between different works of art, connecting both artists and audiences alike through emotional and thematic links that cut across boundaries of genre, culture and era. The Singapore Pinacothèque de Paris Art Academy, La Boutique Pinacothèque museum shop and a unique variety of international retail and dining concepts also converge at Fort Canning Arts Centre to create a vibrant community of art appreciation, education and lifestyle for everyone.","Art Museums, Museums"
